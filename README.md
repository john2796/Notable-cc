Complete Notable Take-Home Challenge
For the take-home, we ask you to implement a web backend that serves up some data with a couple of GET, POST, and DELETE requests (data can be in a DB, or hard-coded, whatever you prefer) Itâ€™s based on an actual problem we solved here and meant to be representative of the kind of work weâ€™d do together day to day week to week.

Youâ€™re free to use whatever languages, frameworks, etc that youâ€™d like. Itâ€™s a good idea to have a hello-world type project set up before you start the problem so you donâ€™t spend time getting things set up

Tips for success on the take-home assignment:

What to do before the project

- Choose tools, languages, and frameworks youâ€™re familiar with and comfortable with. If you want to try something new, we strongly recommend getting familiar before the assignment starts.
- Have your environment ready. Make sure your tools are up to date and configured to work together.
  If youâ€™re planning on using a framework, have it set up and running before the start time.

What to do during the project

- Read the whole problem before starting to code. Weâ€™re looking for candidates who can build the right things.
- Aim to get a working project before polishing or fixing bugs. A feature complete project looks better to us than a bug-free but incomplete project. That said, the fewer bugs the better.
- Aim to submit with the quality you would expect to pass a code review.
