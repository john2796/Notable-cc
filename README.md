For the take-home, we ask you to implement a web backend that serves up some data
with a couple of GET, POST, and DELETE requests (data can be in a DB, or hard-coded, whatever you prefer)
It’s based on an actual problem we solved here and meant to be representative of the kind of work we’d do together day to day week to week.

You’re free to use whatever languages, frameworks, etc that you’d like.
It’s a good idea to have a hello-world type project set up before you start the problem so you don’t spend time getting things set up

Tips for success on the take-home assignment:

What to do before the project
Choose tools, languages, and frameworks you’re familiar with and comfortable with.
If you want to try something new, we strongly recommend getting familiar before the assignment starts.
Have your environment ready. Make sure your tools are up to date and configured to work together.
If you’re planning on using a framework, have it set up and running before the start time.

What to do during the project
Read the whole problem before starting to code. We’re looking for candidates who can build the right things.
Aim to get a working project before polishing or fixing bugs. A feature complete project looks better to us than a bug-free but incomplete project. That said, the fewer bugs the better.
Aim to submit with the quality you would expect to pass a code review.
